// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

sum = a + b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if num % 2 > 0; then
  echo "Number is even"; else
  echo  "Number is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
n = 0
while n < 5;
  v = read "Enter a number: "
    if v - v == 0; then
      if n = 0; then
        a = v
      if n = 1; then 
        b = v
      if n = 2; then
        c = v
      if n = 3; then
        d = v
      if n = 4; then
        e = v  
      n = n + 1

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
avg = (a + b + c + d + e)/5

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
//Find the (s)mallest of the entered numbers
s = a
if b <= s; then
  s = b
if c <= s; then
  s = c
if d <= s; then
  s = d
if e <= s; then
  s = e

//Find the (l)argest of the entered numbers
l = a
if b >= l; then
  l = b
if c >= l; then
  l = c
if d >= l; then
  l = d
if e >= l; then
  l = e

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
echo "The smallest number entered was " s
echo "The largest number entered was " l
